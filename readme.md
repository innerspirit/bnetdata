# bnetdata-test

Proof of concept for getting data from a running StarCraft executable through its internal webserver.

## Usage

Install dependencies, make sure StarCraft Remastered is running, and then run `index.js`.

Requires a Unix like environment to be present at the moment. Untested on Windows, but I think it should work if the WSL is present.

You should get a table displaying the current ladder top 100.
